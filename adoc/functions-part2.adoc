## Learning Objectives

### Concepts

* **Describe** Pure Functions
* **Explain** Function Declaration and Function Assignment
* **Demo** Anonymous Functions
* **Discuss** Rest & Default params

### Skills

* **Understand** Function Assignment
* **Write** any type of function


## Pure Functions

Functions that do *not* change the environment (and thus only return a value) are called *pure* functions. In other words, *pure* functions *have no side-effects*!

Pure functions are important because they are easier to reason about and easier to test because they are completely *deterministic* (i.e. predictable).

Pure functions also provide for easier *composition*.

image::composite-function.png[Composite Function]

Let's look at a comparison

.pure-function
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function multiply(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}
---- 


.function-with-side-effects
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
let x = 10

function multiply(y) {
  x = x * y
  return x
}
---- 

Can you spot the difference? 

The first example: 

- will always return the same value, given the same inputs
- does not affect variables outside it's scope 

The second example will impact `x` and change it every single time. Meaning that we'll never get the same result twice, as `x` is continually changed. 

Please note that it's perfectly fine to write functions that aren't considered "pure". Just be aware that too many functions modifying the global scope can have unintended consequences. 

[TIP]
One of the primary characteristics of *Functional Programming* is that most or all of the functions are *pure* functions.

## Functions as 1st Class Citizens

In computer science, a programming language is said to have *first-class* functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens.

Specifically, this means that the language supports:

* Assigning functions to variables
* Storing functions within data structures
* Passing functions as arguments to other functions
* Returning functions as the value from other functions

NOTE: Treating functions as arguments to other functions is often used in Event Processing. To handle an interesting event a *callback* function is passed into another function and the callback will be called in the future when an interesting DOM event occurs. We will see this technique frequently when we get to DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

## Function Declarations

Function Declaration should feel natural as this is the format we have primarily used up this point in the course.


.simple-declaration
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
---- 

With that in mind, it's worth noting function declaration is not the only way to write functions in JavaScript

## Function Assignment - Storing Functions in Variables

JavaScript can store anything in variables, *_including functions_*!

Here is an example:

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// adder is a variable whose value is a function!
const adder = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// sum is a variable whose value is the sum of 3 and 5.
let sum = adder(3, 5);
----

Functions can also be stored as properties of an object

.functions-as-object-properties
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const mathHelpers = {
  square: function(x) {
    return x * x;
  },
  average: function(x, y) {
    return (x + y) / 2;
  }
};
----


This practice is known as *Function Assignment* and is quite common.


## Anonymous Functions

Functions don't have to have a name or be assigned to a variable. Instead they can be defined and used immediately.

.named-and-anonymous-function-example
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function foo() {
  // This is a named function...
}

function() {
  // This is an anonymous function...
}
----

Common uses of anonymous functions include:

* passing the function as an argument *to another function*, where that function can be used as a callback or event handler
* assigning a function to the property of an object 
* using a function that may only be called once, and does not need to be stored in memory

### Examples of Anonymous Functions

We've actually already seen anonymous functions in use with the `forEach` loop

.forEach-anonymous-function-as-argument
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const associates = ["bob", "emily", "antonio", "elizabeth"]

associates.forEach(function(associate){
  console.log(associate.toUpperCase())
})
---- 

Here we have passed an anonymous function as an argument to `forEach`. As we see below, this could also be a named function. 

.forEach-named-function-as-argument
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const associates = ["bob", "emily", "antonio", "elizabeth"]

function upperCaseAssociates(associate){
  console.log(associate.toUpperCase())
}

associates.forEach(upperCaseAssociates)
---- 

However, given that we only need to use this function once, it makes sense to just use an anonymous function.


Another example is the `reduce` function.

.reduce-anonymous-function-as-argument
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let sum = numbers.reduce(function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
});
---- 

Here we are passing an anonymous function as the argument to `reduce`.


.anonymous-function-with-objects
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const person = {
  name: 'Homer D. Poe',
  age: 29,
  greet: function() {   
    return 'Hello ' + this.name + '!  I see that you are ' + this.age + ' years old!';
  }
};

console.log(person.greet());
----

Above we have assigned an anonymous function to the `greet` property. 

[IMPORTANT]
The function itself is anonymous but it is assigned to
a object property that has a name


.additional-anonymous-function-examples
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const mathHelpers = {
  square: function(x) {
    return x * x;
  },
  average: function(x, y) {
    return (x + y) / 2;
  }
};

let x = mathHelpers.square(4);
let y = mathHelpers.average(5, 9);    

console.log(x,y)
// 16
// 7
----

## Arrow Functions

ES2015 Introduced us to Arrow Functions, a new way to write functions. 

The signature of an arrow function is as follows.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.implicit-return
----
const myFunction = (myParameters) => {
  // do something with myParameters
}
----

- Arrow Functions are function assignments
- place the parameter first
- use a fat arrow `=>`

### Parameters

Arrow functions may take a variety of parameters, and with a variety of syntax.

Arrow functions may have no parameters.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.no-parameters
----
const noParams = ( ) => {
  // do something
}
----

Arrow functions may have single parameters.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.single-parameters
----
const oneParamWithParens = (x) => {
  // do something with x
}

const oneParamWithoutParens = x => {
  // this also works
}
----

[TIP]
Arrow functions with a single parameter don't require parentheses

Arrow functions may have multiple parameters.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.multiple-parameters
----
const multipleParams = (x, y) => {
  // do something with x and y
}
----

### Implicit Returns

Arrow functions have a couple of interesting traits not found in traditional JavaScript functions. 

One of those traits is that arrow functions will _implicitly return_ when consolidated to one line, or wrapped in parentheses

[source,javascript,linenums]
.implicit-return
----
const sum = (x, y) => x + y
----

is equal to:

[source,javascript,linenums]
.implicit-return
----
function sum(x, y){
  return x + y
}
----

Arrow functions also allow for lexical binding which will be discussed later in the course.

## Higher Order Functions and Callbacks

As you dig deeper into the functional nature of JavaScript, it won't be long before you run into the concept of Higher Order Functions, and while the term might sound intimidating, you've already been using them! 

A Higher Order Function has at least one of the two following characteristics:

- Accepts a function as an argument

or 

- Returns a function as it's result

### Accepting a function as an argument

Our favorite array methods are all Higher Order Functions. 

Take a look at `.map` again. 

[source,javascript,linenums]
.map-HOF
----
const numbers = [2, 3, 4]

const squared = numbers.map(function(number){
  return number * number
})

const plusOne = numbers.map(function(num){
  return num + 1
})
----

In the above example, we see `.map` taking in different functions as arguments.

What's interesting is that the functions passed to `.map` perform different operations. `.map` handles implementing each function properly because it is engineered to take a function as an argument.


### Returning a function

We may also choose to return a function. 

[source,javascript,linenums]
.echo
----
function echo(timesToEcho) {

  function printValue(valueToEcho) {           // <1>            
    while (timesToEcho > 0) {                  // <2> 
      console.log(valueToEcho.toUpperCase());  // <3>
      timesToEcho--;                           // <4>
    }; 
  }

  return printValue;                           // <5>
}

const threeEchos = echo(3);                    // <6>
const fiveEchos = echo(5);                     // <7>

threeEchos("hello");
fiveEchos('echooo!');
----

<1> Declare an inner function named `printValue`
<2> Use the `timesToEcho` variable
<3> Print the value (which will be provided later)
<4> Decrement the `timesToEcho` variable
<5> Return the `printValue` function
<6> Invoke the `echo` function, and store the return value (`printValue` function) in `threeEchos`
<7> Store the return value of the `echo` function in `fiveEchos`

This pattern allows us to use functions in interesting ways. For example, let's make a function that imitates a light switch  

[source,javascript,linenums]
.light-switch
----
function lightSwitch(location) {
  return function(action){
    console.log(`turning ${location} light ${action}`)
  }
}

const kitchenLight = lightSwitch('kitchen')
const hallwayLight = lightSwitch('hallway')

kitchenLight('on')
kitchenLight('off')

hallwayLight('on')
hallwayLight('off')
----

### Writing our Own Higher Order Function 

Writing a Higher Order Function is fairly straight-forward.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.introduction
----
function introduction(firstName, lastName, callback) { // <1>
  const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;  // <2>

  callback(fullName); // <3>
}

introduction('foo','bar', function(value){ // <4>
  console.log(`Hello ${value}` )
})
----

<1> Provide a parameter that will ultimately become a function
<2> Concatenate `firstName` and `lastName` variables
<3> Invoke the callback function 
<4> Pass an anonymous function as the `callback` argument

We can also provide named functions as arguments. 

[source,javascript,linenums]
.introduction-with-named-function
----
function introduction(firstName, lastName, callback) {
  const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; 

  callback(fullName); 
}

function welcome(value){
  console.log(`Hi ${value} welcome to OM!`)
}

introduction('foo','bar', welcome)
----

## Parameters & Arguments

While arguments and parameters are often used inter-changeably, there is a difference that is worth discussing. 

* Parameters are a part of the function signature (definition)
* Arguments are the values supplied to a function during invocation. 

[source,javascript,linenums]
.parameters-and-args
----
function sum(x, y){ // <1>
  return x + y
}

sum(2, 3) // <2>
----

<1> `x` and `y` are *parameters* in the function declaration. 
<2> `2` and `3` are *arguments* supplied to the function when called. 

Check out the link:https://pages.github.homedepot.com/OM-JavaScript/JavaScript-Foundations/functions-part2.html#additional_resources[additional resources] section for more info regarding params and args.


## Default Parameters

A welcome change in ES2015 is *default parameters*.

[IMPORTANT]
This feature allows you to pass default arguments to the parameters of your functions.

Before we dive into the syntax, let's look at the ES5 work-around

[source,javascript,linenums]
.ES5
----
function hello(name) {
  name = name || 'Mystery Person';

  console.log('Hello ' + name + "!");
}

hello("Bob");

hello();
----

While this is a very clever work-around, it can backfire when dealing with booleans and numbers.

Let's look at how to use *default params*

[source,javascript,linenums]
.ES2015
----
function hello(name = "Mystery Person"){
    console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
}

hello("Cliff");

hello();
----

Multiple default parameters can be added and mixed with regular parameters.

[TIP]
However, keep in mind that *parameters without _default's_
will initially receive the value of undefined* (like normal).

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function hello(day, name = "Mystery Person"){
    console.log(`Hello ${name}! have a great ${day}`);
}

hello();
----

## Rest Parameters

The *rest parameter* lets you pass an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

Rest parameters are invoked using the `...` syntax

This is similar to the *arguments* object in ES5. However, *rest parameters* offer significant advantages.

[IMPORTANT]
Arguments is a special object supplied to functions by JavaScript.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.using-arguments-object
----
function add() {
    console.log("arguments object:", arguments);

    let numbers = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments); //<1>

    let sum = 0;

    numbers.forEach(function (number) {
       sum += number;
    });
    return sum;
}

console.log(add(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8));
// arguments object: {"0":1,"1":2,"2":3,"3":4,"4":5,"5":6,"6":7,"7":8}
// 36
----

<1> We first have to convert the *arguments* object into an
array, because it's not an _actual array_

[TIP]
Rest parameters on the other hand, provides an *actual array* _meaning
methods like `sort`, `map`, `forEach` and `pop` can be applied on it
directly_.


[source,javascript,linenums]
.with-rest-params
----
function add(...numbers){
  console.log("rest parameters:", numbers);

  let sum = 0;

  numbers.forEach(function (number) {
    sum += number;
  });
  return sum;
}

 console.log(add(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8));
----

As you can see, this new syntax is much more readable. You can immediately tell this function can take any number of arguments.

_Just for fun, lets use `reduce` and arrow functions to make our `add` function a one-line statement_

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
let add = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((sum, number) => sum += number, 0)

console.log(add(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8));
----

It's also possible to combine `rest` parameters with multiple arguments

[source,javascript,linenums]
.multiple arguments
----
function addStuff(x, y, ...z) {
    return (x + y) * z.length
}

console.log(addStuff(1, 2, "hello", "world", true, 99));
// 12
----

[IMPORTANT]
rest parameters must be the last argument in the function
signature

## LAB 3 - Calculator Revisited

Complete link:https://github.homedepot.com/OM-JavaScript/JavaScript-Foundations-Exercises/tree/master/calculator#part-2---single-calculator-function[part 2^] of the calculator challenge, then move on to the link:https://github.homedepot.com/OM-JavaScript/JavaScript-Foundations-Exercises/tree/master/calculator#extra-credit[extra credit^] challenges.

- Remove pending status from the remaining tests (including the extra credit test)
- Write the code to make the tests pass

- starter code can be found at: `calculator/calculator.js`
- tests can be found at: `calculator/\__tests__/calculator.test.js`
- tests can be started with `npm run test:calculator`

## Summary

* Functions can be *named* or *anonymous*.
* *Pure* functions do not have side-effects and are thus easier to test and maintain!
* Higher Order Functions take in a function as an argument and/or return a function
* Rest Parameters offer a welcome alternative to the `arguments` object and allow a virtually unlimited number of arguments.
