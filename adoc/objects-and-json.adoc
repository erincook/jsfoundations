## Learning Objectives

### Concepts

* Explain how to work with objects in JavaScript
* Introduce JSON
* Discuss the difference between primitive and reference types

### Skills

* Build complex objects
* List, update, mutate properties of objects

## Objects

An object is a set of keys and values, like a dictionary.

[source,javascript]
----
var course = {
	name: 'Orange Method',
	awesome: true
}
----

Values can be primitive objects, arrays, or other objects

[source,javascript]
----
var course = {
	name: 'Orange Method Full-Stack JS',
	awesome: true,
	students: ['Dawn', 'Duane'],
	instructor: {
		name: 'Shane',
		title: 'Senior Training Software Engineer'
	}
}
----

### Addressing an Object

Object properties can be referenced in two ways. The more common _dot_ notation, as well as  _bracket_ notation, which is useful if you have a property name saved in a string.

[source,javascript]
----
course.name
course['name']
----

You can combine dot and bracket notation to address infinitely deeply nested values inside objects.

[source,javascript]
----
var course = {
	name: 'Orange Method Full-Stack JS',
	awesome: true,
	teachers: ['Brandon', 'Mike', 'Shane']
}

console.log(course.teachers[0]); // Brandon
----

A more complex example:

[source,javascript]
----
var course = {
	name: 'Orange Method Full-Stack JS',
	awesome: true,
	teachers: ['Brandon', 'Shane', 'Mike'],
	students: [
		{
			name: 'Cliff',
			computer: {
				OS: 'macOS',
				type: 'iMac'
			}
		}
	]
};

console.log(course.students[0].computer.OS);

----

### Update an Object

Properties of objects can be updated after an object is created.

[source,javascript]
----
course.name = "super fun class";
----

### Mutate an Object

You can also assign new keys and delete existing ones.

[source,javascript]
----
course.fun = true; //add a property
delete course.name; //remove one
----

### LAB 1 - Addressing Objects

Using the link:https://repl.it/@shanebarringer/working-with-objects-exercise[repl.it sample^] found below. Print the following values to the console:

. Name of the course ('Orange Method Full-Stack JS')
. Name of the second teacher ('Shane')
. Name of the first student ('Donna')
. Alex's computer type ('iMac')
. The preReq equipment object
. The second OS Option from equipment preReq's ('macOS')
. string listing the OS Options separated by 'or' ('linux or macOS')
. An array of all the students that are using macOS.

### Destructuring Assignment

One of the many features that ES2015 (aka ES6) brought us is Destructuring Assignment.

While destrucuring might sound like an intimidating concept, but in all reality it's simple and great!

According to link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment[Mozilla]

[quote]
____
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects into distinct variables.
____

[TIP]
In other words, With *destructuring* you can store array items as individual variables during assignment.



### Array Destructuring

We're going to start with Array destructuring.

Consider the following examples:

[source,javascript,linenums]
.ES5
----
var engineers = ["Jeremy", "Joyce", "Virginia"];
var x = engineers[0];
var y = engineers[1];
var z = engineers[2];

console.log(x, y, z);
----

As you can see, we had to declare individual variables at each index position. As an alternative, we could have created a loop of some kind, but it's a lot of logic for a simple task.

This is where Array Destructuring shines

[source,javascript,linenums]
.ES2015
----
let engineers = ["Jeremy", "Joyce", "Virginia"];
let [x,y,z] = engineers <1>

console.log(x,y,z);
----

<1> Assign each array item (in order) to the variables within the brackets

As you can see, this incredibly useful and readable. It also allows for scalability of your code.

*Destructuring* also allows you to omit values

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
let students = ["Jeremy", "Joyce", "Virginia"];
let[ ,y,z] = students

console.log(y,z);
----

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
let students = ["Jeremy", "Joyce", "Virginia"];
let[x,,y] = students

console.log(x,y);
----

Destructuring Assignment can also be used in creative ways with functions (which will be showcased soon).


### Object Destructuring

*Destructuring* assignment with objects should work exactly as you are hoping.

Let's take a look.

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const instructor = {
  name: "Shane",
  email: "shane_barringer@homedepot.com"
}
const { name: name, email: email } = instructor; // <1>

console.log(name); <2>
// Shane
----

<1> Map the `name` variable to `instructor.name` and the `email` to `instructor.email`

<2> log the `name` variable

We can also assign new variable names,

[source,javascript,linenums]
.New-Variables
----
const instructor = {
  name: "Shane",
  email: "shane_barringer@homedepot.com"
}
const { name: x, email: y } = instructor; // <1>

console.log(x);
// Shane
----

<1> Assign `instructor.name` to the `x` variable & `instructor.email` to the `y` variable.

This also works with deeply nested values.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.Deeply-Nested
----
const instructor = {
  name: "Shane",
  contactInfo: {
	  ldap: "mxb5594",
  	  email: "shane_barringer@homedepot.com"
  }
}

const { name, contactInfo: { ldap, email } } = instructor;

console.log(email)
// shane_barringe@homedepot.com
----


One other neat feature that ES2015 brought us, is the ability to write shorthand syntax with objects. Meaning that if the new key being assigned has the same name as the existing property, you can write the value once.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.Using-Shorthand
----
const { name, contactInfo: { email } } = instructor;
----

The above example works exactly as expected. Additionally, this technique can be used in Object creation.


#### Destructuring in the real world.

When using a library like React, you'll often find it much less verbose (and easier) to use destructuring assignment in your components.

Let's take a look at a practical example

[source,javascript,linenums]
.real-world
----
// ...

this.state = {
	name: 'foo',
	email: 'foo@bar.io',
	admin: true
}

// ...

const { name, email, admin } = this.state

// Do something with name and email
----

## JSON

You've probably heard of JSON. It's a text-based data format based on JavaScript object syntax. In fact JSON is an acronym that stands for *JavaScript Object Notation*.

JSON is used to store data and exchange that data between applications.

[NOTE]
An important difference between JavaScript objects and JSON is that proper JSON requires double quotes around the property names. This is also valid in JS, but not required.

### Proper JSON

[source,javascript]
----
{
	"name" : "Orange Method Full-Stack JS",
	"awesome" : true
}
----

JSON works with multiple languages and makes the exchange of data very simple and straightforward.

As we move into working with (and building) API's you will find yourselves working with JSON extensively.

## Primitive vs Reference types

In JavaScript, primitive types like numbers and strings are _assigned by value_. Objects and Arrays (which are also objects) are assigned by reference.

A _value_ variable holds its value like you might expect. A _reference_ variable points to an object in memory.

* Re-assigning a value type actually changes it's value.
* Re-assigning a reference type makes it point to a different object in memory.
* Comparison of reference types compares the memory location, not value.

Before proceeding, take a moment to read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13266616/primitive-value-vs-reference-value/13268731#13268731[this excellent StackOverflow post^] regarding primitive and reference values

Here are a few of examples to further illustrate:

[source,javascript]
.value types
----
var x = 1;
var y = 1;
x === y; //true

var y = x; 	// x == 1, y == 1
x === y; 	// true

x = 2; 		// x == 2, y == 1
x === y; 	// false
----

[source,javascript]
.reference types
----
var x = {name: 'Deirdre'}
var y = {name: 'Deirdre'}
x === y; //false;

var y = x; 		//x and y are {name: 'Deirdre'}
x === y;		//true

x.name = 'Kelly'
y.name; // 'Kelly'

----

## LAB 3 - Build an Email Client

Pair with a teammate to create an object that models the data of your favorite email application.

Instructions can be found link:email-client-lab.html[here^]

## Summary

* Objects are simply key/value pairs
* Objects can be accessed in a similar manner to arrays. ie: `myObj.someKey`
* An object's keys/properties can be
** created (after instantiation)
** mutated
** deleted
* JSON looks like a JavaScript Object
** JSON's keys must be strings
** JSON is understood by multiple languages
* DataType's like strings and numbers are primitive
* Object's, functions, and array's are reference types.
