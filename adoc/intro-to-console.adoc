## Learning Objectives

### Concepts

* Introduce the `window`, global objects, and location
* Understand the DOM's history interface
* Discuss local and session storage


### Skills

* Gain comfort interacting with the console


## Global Objects


The global object is created as soon as the Javascript interpreter starts. For Javascript running inside a browser, this means that as soon as a new page is loaded by the browser, the global object will be
created.

[TIP]
In browsers, the `window` object doubles as the `global` object, meaning that `this` initially refers the `window`

some examples:

[source,javascript]
----
window.alert();
window.prompt();
window.confirm();
----

is the same as:

[source,javascript]
----
this.alert();
this.prompt();
this.confirm();
----

[IMPORTANT]
When scripts are loaded into an html document, the browser
inserts some globals for us

Some other examples of globals include:

* functions such as: `parseFloat()`
* properties such as `NaN`
* objects such as `Math`

In summary, the `window` object is basically a representation of an
individual browser window. (otherwise no)

## Location

The `window.location` object can be used to get the current page address
(URL) and to redirect the browser to a new page.

[source,javascript]
----
window.location.href <1>

window.location.hash <2>

window.location.hostname <3>
----
<1> returns the href (URL) of the current page
To see this in action, try this is the console (from any page)
<2> sets or returns the anchor part of a URL, including the hash sign (#)
<3> returns the domain name of the web host
ope
[source,javascript]
----
window.location.href = "http://www.google.com"
----

## History


The `history` interface allows to manipulate the browser session
history, that is the pages visited in the tab or frame that the
_current_ page is loaded in.

* `window.history.back();` Goes to the previous page in session history,
(the same action as when the user clicks the browser's Back button)
* `window.history.forward();` Goes to the next page in session history,
(the same action as when the user clicks the browser's Forward button)
* `window.history.go();`
** takes an argument
** `window.history.go(1);` moves forward one page
** `window.history.go(-1);` moves back one page
* HTML5 pushstate The `history.pushState()` method adds a state to the
browsers history.

[source,javascript]
----
var stateObj = { foo: "bar" };
history.pushState(stateObj, "page 2", "bar.html");
----

Running the above code will cause the URL bar to display
`http://your-site-name.com/bar.html`

`pushState()` takes three parameters:

* a state object
* a title (which is currently ignored)
* an optional URL


## Dimensions and Position


* `window.innerWidth` returns the inner width of a window's content
area.
* `window.innerHeight` returns the inner height of a window's content
area.

[CAUTION]
these properties are read-only.

Another nifty feature is `window.scrollY` and `window.scrollX`

X and Y represent the X and Y axis of the window

* Y is the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled from
the top
* X is the number of pixels that the document is currently scrolled from
the left

[source,javascript]
----
// scroll to the bottom of a page and then paste this into the console

if (window.scrollY) {
  window.scroll(0, 0);  // will reset the scroll position to the top left of the document.
}
----

[source,javascript]
----
var y = window.scrollY;

window.scroll(0, 0);

window.scroll(0, y);
----

## `localStorage` & `sessionStorage`

Storage objects are simple key-value pairs (similar to objects) they
stay intact through page loads.

* The *keys* can be strings or integers
* the *values* are always strings. +
* You can access these values like an object
* or with the `getItem()` and `setItem()` methods.

The `sessionStorage` property allows you to access a session `Storage`
object.

* Data stored in `sessionStorage` gets cleared when the page session
ends.
* A page session lasts for as long as the browser is open and survives
over page reloads
* Opening a page in a new tab or window will cause a new session to be
initiated

`localStorage` while property similar to `sessionStorage` has:

* no expiration time
* persists even when the browser is closed and re-opened

The `setItem()` method will add (or update) a key/value pair to the
Storage object

[source,javascript]
----
localStorage.setItem('bgcolor', 'aqua');
----

While the `getItem()` method will return that key's value.

[source,javascript]
----
localStorage.getItem('bgcolor'); // "aqua"
----

Mozilla has a great demonstration link:http://mdn.github.io/web-storage-demo/[here^]

Head over there and change the values, while calling `localStorage` to see the key/value pairs

### A Note on Serialization

You may have noticed that these key/value pairs resemble JSON. However, Attempting to store a JSON object in local storage will result in an error.

Local storage requires you to store *strings* of information.

_To store a JSON object in local storage you will need to convert it into a JSON-formatted string_, using the `JSON.stringify()` method.

[source,javascript]
----
var user = {
  name : "Shane",
  job : "instructor"
};

var storeUser = JSON.stringify(user);

localStorage.setItem('userInfo', storeUser);

localStorage.getItem('userInfo');
// "{"name":"Shane","job":"instructor"}"

var serialized = localStorage.getItem('userInfo');

console.log(serialized);
// {"name":"Shane","job":"instructor"}
----

As previously discussed, this process is known as serialization. When working with API's you'll often need to serialize and/or de-serialize data.

In our case, we could turn this JSON formatted string back into an object by calling `JSON.parse(serialized)`

## LAB 1 - Working with the console

* Loading an existing javascript file into your browser
* Once loaded:
** Access the variables/arrays
** Call functions from console
* Make the program interactive
* Ask the user for input
* Log results to the console
* Display input on the DOM

## Summary

The JavaScript console gives us a REPL in the browser. Allowing us to interact with the `window` object, as well as our own code.
