## Learning Objectives

### Concepts

* Explain JavaScript *context* and what the value of the `this` keyword refers to
* Demo the `this` keyword and explain when/how it is used
* Explain the default context of Javascript
* Use `bind` to create a new method bound to an object context
* Use `apply`/`call` to execute a method in a different context
* Demonstrate lexical `this` with arrow functions

### Skills

* Use the `this` keyword to set and retrieve a property in a Javascript function
* Know how to keep the appropriate context in your applications

## What is context?

Context is feature of the Javascript language related to how and when/where functions are invoked (aka called).

In short, the _context is the *object* that a function is *attached* to_. (Though we'll see that context can change under certain circumstances).

Every time a Javascript function is called, a context is determined and/or set. 

That context is always an object, and can be referenced (in the function definition) using the `this` keyword  

[IMPORTANT]
`this` is a reserved word in JavaScript, like `function`, `break`, `new` `import`, etc. 

Here's an example of the most common way context is determined for a function

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const instructor = {
  fullName: 'Homer D. Poe',
  favoriteFood: 'Steak',
  sayHello: function() {
    console.log('Hi! My name is ' + this.fullName + ', and my favorite food is ' + this.favoriteFood);
  }
};

instructor.sayHello() // for this function invocation, `this` is `instructor`
----

[TIP]
When a method is called on an object, that object becomes the context.

This feature allows not just 'getting' property info on objects, but also
setting properties. Consider this example:

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const xwing = {
    pilot: null,

    setPilot: function(newPilot) {
        this.pilot = newPilot;
        this.notifyUpdate();
    },

    notifyUpdate: function() {
        console.log('This X-Wing has changed!');
    }
};

xwing.setPilot("Luke Skywalker");
// >> "This X-Wing has changed!"

console.log(xwing.pilot);
// >> "Luke Skywalker"
----

## Default Context

When a function is called, but it's not a method on an object, and no context
is otherwise assigned (see later sections), then the context is set to the
default context. In a browser, the default context is the `window` object.

In NodeJS, the default object is called the global object.

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function revealThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

revealThis();
----

## Gotcha With `this`

### Class Discussion

Consider the following code sample...


Using what we know about context, predict what the value of `this` will be on the lines where `this` is used.


.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const instructor = {
  fullName: 'Homer D. Poe',
  favoriteFoods: ['Pizza', 'Pad Thai', 'Steak'],
  displayFoods: function() {
    console.log('Favorite foods for', this.fullName);
    this.favoriteFoods.forEach(function(food) {
      console.log(this.fullName + ' likes ' + food);
    })
  }
};

instructor.displayFoods();
----

### Answer

In the first case, `this` behaves like we would expect, (it references `instructor` since it's inside a function attached to an `instructor`.

In the second case, `this` is inside an _anonymous function_, so it refers to the *global* object!

Note that this issue frequently appears anytime we use a *callback* / *anonymous function*, such as:

* using `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()` to schedule callbacks
* using `forEach()` or other iteration functions
* event listeners passed into `someElement.addEventListener()`

## Fixes for the `this` gotcha

### Closure Hack

One trick is to store the `this` you want in another variable, commonly named `self` or `that`.

.closure-hack
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const instructor = {
  fullName: 'Homer D. Poe',
  favoriteFoods: ['Pizza', 'Pad Thai', 'Steak'],
  displayFoods: function() {
    const self = this;
    console.log('Favorite foods for', self.fullName);
    this.favoriteFoods.forEach(function(food) {
      console.log(self.fullName + ' likes ' + food);
    })
  }
};

instructor.displayFoods();
----

**Mini-Discussion**: Use what we know about scope to explain why this fix works.

### Bind

Another way is to address the `this` issue is to use the `bind` method on the function. 

This will force the function to always use the specified value as it's context.

.bind-method
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const instructor = {
  fullName: 'Homer D. Poe',
  favoriteFoods: ['Pizza', 'Pad Thai', 'Steak'],
  displayFoods: function() {
    console.log('Favorite foods for', this.fullName);
    this.favoriteFoods.forEach(function(food) {
      console.log(this.fullName + ' likes ' + food);
    }.bind(this));
  }
};

instructor.displayFoods();
----

### Call/Apply

There are two other ways to invoke a function and change the context, which are very similar: `call` and `apply`.

Here's an example of how to use call:

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hi! My name is " + this.name);
}

const person = {name: "Manatee the Railyard Toreador"};
const cat = {name: "Hobbles McGillicudy"};
sayHello.call(person);
sayHello.call(cat);
----

`call` also lets us pass in the arguments to the function:

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function sayHello(favColor) {
  console.log("Hi! My name is " + this.name + " and I like " + favColor);
}

const person = {name: "Manatee the Railyard Toreador"};
const cat = {name: "Hobbles McGillicudy"};
sayHello.call(person, "blue");
sayHello.call(cat, "peachpuff");
----

`apply` works almost exactly like `call`, only you pass in an *array* of arguments instead of a comma-separated list.

See the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply[MDN documentation^] for more.

### Arrow functions

Okay, so we've saved the best for last. 

[IMPORTANT]
Arrow functions use _lexical binding_, which simply means:
*arrow functions bind to the scope of where they are _defined_ not where they are used*

In other words, arrow functions interpret `this` at the time of *declaration*. This is different from traditional JS functions as they use *dynamic* scope and interpret `this` at the runtime (whenever they are called/invoked). 


Let's look at an example.

.arrow-function
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// ...

    this.favoriteFoods.forEach(food => {
      console.log(this.fullName + ' likes ' + food);
    }

// ...
instructor.displayFoods();
----

Above, the arrow function defines `this` when the function is declared.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.arrow-function-inside-of-function
----
const teacher = {
    name: 'Shane',
    speak: function() {
        let boundFunction = () => {
            console.log('later my name is ' + this.name);
        }

        setTimeout(boundFunction,1000);
    }
}

teacher.speak();
----


## Four Ways of Defining Context

There are 4 ways that context (this) can be defined for a function invocation. In order of precedence, the 4 ways are:

. Is the function called with `new` (*new binding*)? If so, `this` is the newly constructed objects

    const supreme_pizza = new Pizza();

. Is the function called with `call` or `apply` (*explicit binding*), even hidden inside a `bind` *hard binding*? If so, `this` is the explicitly specified object.

    const baked_pizza = bake.call( raw_pizza );

. Is the function called with a context (*implicit binding*), otherwise known as an owning or containing object? If so, `this` is *that* context object.

    const baked_pizza = raw_pizza.bake();

. Otherwise, default the `this` (*default binding*). If in `strict mode`, pick `undefined`, otherwise pick the `global` object.

    const probably_wont_work = bake();

## Summary

Context is the object that a function is attached to.

When/where a function is invoked depends on context.

Context can change in certain circumstances.

Context is determined dynamically at runtime when the function is *invoked*, _except_ in the case of arrow functions which are lexically bound to the context where they are *declared*.
