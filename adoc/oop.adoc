## Learning Objectives

### Concepts

* Showcase Object Orientation within JavaScript
* Discuss the differences between classical and prototypal inheritance
* Learn about Prototypes and Constructor functions


### Skills

* Explain when to use prototypes and constructors
* Understanding of JavaScript object orientation

## Constructors

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming model organized around objects rather than "actions". Essentially, data, rather than logic.

While JavaScript is more suited to functional programming, it does have some Object Oriented features that we need to understand.

Some key concepts in OO:

* Class - A template (or blueprint) for a new object
* Instance - A single object created from a class
* Inheritance - A class or object can inherit properties from a parent class
* Encapsulation - Enclosing an object's data and functionality inside of it.

### LAB 1 - Dog Objects

* Create a dog object with the following properties:
** Name
** Owner
** Age
** Gender
** A `speak` functions that log's "woof, woof" to the console
* Once you've built your object, create 3 more dog objects with the new values. +
_note: you can re-use the speak function_
* make your objects speak!


### Classes

As you can see, this repetition of creating objects can become quite tedious. Even with lots of copying and pasting, you're probably thinking _there has to be a better way_

Traditional Object Oriented languages aim to solve this problem by creating classes. A class serves as a template for objects that you'll be creating. This means that you would craft a class with specific attributes that your object will need to have.

For example, an `Instructor` class, might have:

* The instructor's name
* Lesson they'll be teaching
* etc

This logic (in part) is available in JavaScript, let's take a look at a simple example

In JS, you create (what appears to be) a class by simply defining a constructor.

[IMPORTANT]
A constructor is a function used to create a new instance of an object

[TIP]
Constructor functions can be considered object factories

[source,javascript,linenums]
.Simple Example
----
function Teacher(name) {
	this.name = name; // <1>
	this.teach = function() {
		console.log(this.name + " says constructors are cool");
	}
}

const teacher1 = new Teacher('Shane'); <2>
const teacher2 = new Teacher('Brandon');

teacher1.teach();
teacher2.teach();
----


<1> Attributes are assigned to the object using the `this` keyword
<2> The `new` keyword calls the function and returns the resulting object.

[TIP]
This pattern is a good choice if you need to repeatedly created objects

[NOTE]
In this example, we are passing arguments into the constructor to customize our object

### LAB 2 - Pet Constructors

Use constructor functions to refactor your dog objects

* Detailed instructions can be found here link:https://github.homedepot.com/OM-JavaScript/JavaScript-Foundations-Exercises/blob/master/objects/instructions/02-Object-Orientation.md[Constuctor Exercises^]

* The starter code can be found link:https://github.homedepot.com/OM-JavaScript/JavaScript-Foundations-Exercises/blob/master/objects/object-orientation.js[here^]

* The tests can be started with `npm run test:object-orientation`

## Inheritance (Classical vs Prototypal)

Traditional Object Oriented languages use a pattern of Classical Inheritance.

Classical Inheritance models the world in terms of classes. +
_ie: a `Teacher` class inherits from the`Person` class._

JavaScript, on the other hand, uses *Prototypal Inheritance*, which is *instance* based.

[source,javascript, linenums]
.simple-example
----
function Teacher(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

Teacher.prototype = {
	teach: function(){
		console.log('Prototypes are important, says ' + this.name);
	}
}

const teach1 = new Teacher('shane');
const teach2 = new Teacher('brandon')
teach1.teach();
teach2.teach()
----

In the above example, our objects inherit properties from the Teacher prototype object.

How is this different than just using constructors?

* A prototype object is a live instance
* The prototype object is shared across all instances.

[TIP]
`Teacher.prototype` is an object

[source,javascript, linenums]
----
function Teacher(name) {
	this.name = name;
}

Teacher.prototype = {
	disposition: 'evil'
}

const shane = new Teacher('shane');
const mike = new Teacher('mike');
console.log(shane.disposition, mike.disposition) //evil, evil

Teacher.prototype.disposition = 'happy';
console.log(shane.disposition, mike.disposition) //happy, happy
----

### Constructors vs Prototype

These two techniques seem pretty similar. When would you use one over the other?

* *Constructors*
** Once an instance is created, it no longer has a connection to the class or other instances.
* *Prototype*
** Gives you the power to control many instances after creation
** Is more memory efficient because it removes duplication

### LAB 3 - Pet Prototypes

* Remove the `speak` function and `species` property from your constructor
* Using Prototypes...
** Add the `speak` function and `species` property
** Create a `playFetch` function that uses the owner and pet's name to play fetch. +
_ie: Shane throws tennis ball for Hezekiah to find and bring back_

### Prototype Chain

What happens if an instance has a property with the same name as a prototype property?

[source, javascript, linenums]
----
function Teacher() {}

Teacher.prototype = {
	name: 'John Doe'
}

const shane = new Teacher();
const mike = new Teacher();

shane.name = "Shane";

console.log(shane.name, mike.name) //'Shane', 'John Doe'
----

If `name` is a prototype property, why didn't it change both instances' names?

This works just like scope chains

[TIP]
A property name is resolved by looking at the instance first. If the instance does not have a property with that name, then JS looks at the instance's prototype.

Defining a property on an instance simply covers over the prototype's property. It doesn't replace it.

[TIP]
Think of instance properties as being "layered" on top of the prototype


Prototype objects can have their own prototypes, resulting in a prototype chain. To resolve a property, the interpreter will look at the instance, then it's prototype, then its prototype's prototype, and so on.

[quote, Kyle Simpson, You Don't Know JS - this and Object Prototypes]
____
In JavaScript, we don't make copies from one object ("class") to another ("instance"). We make links between objects.
____


[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function Person(){
	this.brain = true;
};
function Student(){
	this.computer = true;
};
function Graduate(){
	this.skillz = 'Mad'
};

const p = new Person();
Student.prototype = p;

const s = new Student();
Graduate.prototype = s;

const g = new Graduate();

console.log(g.skillz, g.computer, g.brain);

----

### hasOwnProperty

Objects have a method called 'hasOwnProperty' that tells you if a method is defined on an instance itself or one of its parent prototypes.

[source,javascript]
----
//Using example above
console.log(g.hasOwnProperty('skillz'),g.hasOwnProperty('computer'))

----

* Note - `Object.create()` is an easy (and better) way to instantiate an object based on a prototype.

[TIP]
Prototype chains are important to understand, but try not to create complex class hierarchies in your JS code.

## Object Composition

An alternative to using inheritance is something known as Object Composition. This is also known as the *mixin pattern*.

### The `Object.assign()` Method

We can use `Object.assign(target, [...sources])` to copy properties from one or more objects into another without connecting them

[source,javascript]
----
const lion = {
	roar: function(){console.log('roar')}
}

const goat = {
	kick: function(){console.log('kick')}
}

const lizard = {
	tail: true
}

const chimera = {}
Object.assign(chimera, lion, goat, lizard);

chimera.roar();
chimera.kick();
chimera.tail;
----

Another example, could be that you need to get protected info from an API. The API is going to require some kind of verification.

Given that your production and development setting are going to differ, you could create a base object with relevant info for prod. You can then clone that object and update only the info necessary for local development. 

[source,javascript]
.config.js
----
const baseConfig = { 								// <1>
	appName: 'BestAppEver', 						// <2>
	apiSecret: '<process.env.SUPER_SECRET>', 		// <2>
	apiKey: '123456789', 							// <2>
	apiBaseUrl: 'https://best-app-ever.com/api/' 	// <2>
}

const localConfig = Object.assign({}, baseConfig,   // <3>
	{ 
		apiKey: 'localDeveloperKey', 				// <4>
		apiBaseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/api' 	// <4>
	}
);

console.log(localConfig.appName, localConfig.apiBaseUrl);
----

<1> Create an base object
<2> Provide your key/pair values (like normal)
<3> using `Object.assign()` supply the following arguments + 
   . set the target as a new empty object
   . supply the `baseConfig` as a source you want to clone/copy
   . provide an object (as the third argument), with properties you want to modify or add +
<4> For the third argument, provide the info you want to modify

### The Spread Operator `...`

ES2105 also gave us the gift of the *spread operator* which allows us to spread out the values found in arrays and objects. 

The syntax for the spread operator looks just like an ellipses `...` 

[NOTE]
The `...` syntax is also used for Rest parameters

#### Array Spread

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
let random = ["Hello", "world", true, 99];
let newArray = [1,2, ...random, 3];

console.log(newArray);
//[1,2,"Hello","world",true,99,3]
----

Another example, _spreading_ out the characters in an array or string. 


For example let's separate out the characters found in "Hello World" and place them into an array.

[source,javascript,linenums]
.spread-characters
----
let hi = "Hello World"
let hiArray = [ ...hi ]

console.log(hiArray);
// ["H","e","l","l","o"," ","W","o","r","l","d"]
----

So, how is this relevant to the current topic of Object Composition? 

I'm glad you asked!

[TIP]
We can use the spread operator easily to clone arrays and objects. 

As you may have noticed above, we easily the original array into a new array and added additional values. With that in mind, let's look at a more simplistic example

[source,javascript,linenums]
.clone-array
----
const students = ["kelly", "emily", "matt"]
const graduates = [ ...students ]

console.log(graduates);
----


#### Object Spread

Can you guess the syntax for Object Spread?  

Object spread swaps in `{}` for `[]` 

[source,javascript,linenums]
.clone-object
----
const course = {
	name: "JavaScript Foundations",
	awesome: true,
	complete: false
}

const finishedCourse = {...course, complete: true} // <1>

console.log(course, finishedCourse);
----

<1> clone the `course` object and update the `complete` value

This syntax serves as an alternative to `Object.assign()`

You will see this pattern widely used, out in the wild, when working with libraries that stress immutability. 

One popular library you may have seen that implements this type of pattern is Redux. While Redux is outside of the scope of this course (OM does have a React-Redux Pillar Course btw!), it is useful to see the pattern in action. 

[source,javascript,linenums]
.redux-example
----
function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return { ...state, visibilityFilter: action.filter }
    // ...
  }
}
----

One final thought on the syntactical differences of `Object.assign()` or `...`


Use whatever syntax makes the most sense for you and your team.

The important thing to note is that you are using Object Composition, and that deserves a high five!

## LABS 

### planetproto

* Head on over to the link:https://github.com/sporto/planetproto[Planet Proto GitHub page^] and follow the readme to get up and running
* Alternatively, you can simply follow the steps below:
** If you are using your own device, install planetproto. `npm install -g planetproto@latest` +
_note: this is already installed on all OM devices_
** create a new directory named *planetproto*
** `cd` into that directory
** run `npm install planetproto`
** once the install finishes, run `planetproto` and follow the instructions

### Mixins

* Create a user profile object that contains properties for
** name
** address
** city
** state
** zipcode
** avatar
* Write a function named `getProfileUpdate()` that _hypothetically_ asks the user to update their profile properties
** this function should return information about the properties that were changed and list the new values. +
_note: for now, just hard code the return value_
* Write a function `updateProfile()` that takes a single object of _keys & values_ that overwrites those keys on the profile object
* Using `getProfileUpdate`, update the user's profile
* log the new profile


## Summary

While at it's core JavaScript is a functional language, making use of these object oriented principles can provide very fun and creative ways to accomplish your tasks.

Understanding Prototypes is essential to becoming a solid JS developer.
