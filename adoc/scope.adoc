## Learning Objectives

### Concepts

* Define 'scope' in the context of programming
* Describe the rules of scope in Javascript
* Describe the impact of hoisting on variable scope
* Discuss the scoping rules for variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const`

## Introduction

Understanding JavaScript scope is key to writing bulletproof code and becoming a better developer. You will understand where variables and functions are accessible, and be able to change the scope of your codeâ€™s context and be able to write more maintainable code.

## What is Scope?

Scope is the part of the program where a variable is bound to a memory location. 

You can think of the scope as the lifetime of the variable (where in the program the variable is born and where it dies or is discarded).

[TIP]
In other words, scope is where a variable can be referenced or used.


## Rules of Scope in JS

In Javascript, there are two primary types of scope: *global* and *local* scope.

* *Global* variables alive for the entire duration of the program execution.
* *Local* variables are alive during a part of the execution of the program.

To understand scope, there are a handful of principles that you should know.

* Variables initially created without the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords _are placed in the global scope_.
* Variables created with the `var`, `let` or `const` keywords are available in the _local_ *function* scope.
* All functions create a new local *function* scope for themselves.

### Exercise - Function Scope Discussion

Review the code below with a teammate and (without running the code) discuss where each variable can be accessed and used.  


.function-scope
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
const president = "Everyone knows me. Globally!";

function town() {
  const mayor = "I'm unknown outside of my township.";

  function house() {
    const homebody = "No one knows me. " +
      "I don't leave home. " +
      "but I know the mayor and the president.";
  }

  evilLeader = "I am evil! Want to know why?";
}
----

### Rules of Scope Continued 

Before ES2015 local variables were scoped by their enclosing `function`. ES2015 introduced a new *lexical* scope for variables declared with the `let` or `const` keywords.

* Variables created with the `let` or `const` keywords are available in the _local_ *block* (and function) scope.

* Blocks create a new local *block* scope for themselves.
* The scope includes *all* outer (enclosing) scopes.

### Rules of Scope TLDR

* Local variables defined inside a function or block cannot be accessed from anywhere
outside the function or block.
* A function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined. 

In other words, inner scopes inherit the variables from the outer scopes, but not vice-versa.

WARNING: Variables defined outside of any function are inherently global even if the `var`, `let`, or `const` keyword is used!

## Examples

As a class, let's step through the following examples together.

### Simple

A simple example might include a function that pulls in variables from it's outer scope. 

.play-baseball
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
favoriteSport = "Baseball"  // no var -> global
var favoriteBaseballTeam = "Braves"; // global because not in any function

function playBaseball() {
  console.log(favoriteSport); // works, globals always in scope
  console.log(favoriteBaseballTeam);   // works, local variable in outer scope

  pitcherName    = "Brandon Kearns";
  var batterName = "Mike Hopper";

  console.log(batterName);  // works, local variable in scope
  console.log(pitcherName); // works, globals always in scope
}

playBaseball()
----

Running this function should work as expected, because the calls to `console.log` happen inside of `playBaseball`, which has access to variables scoped both locally and globally.

However, what happens when we try to all of the variables (outside of the `playBaseball` function)?

.play-baseball
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// ... 

console.log(favoriteSport); // <1>
console.log(favoriteBaseballTeam);   // <2> 

console.log(pitcherName); // <3>
console.log(batterName);  // <4>

console.dir(window); // <5>
----

<1> works, globals always in scope
<2> works, local to current scope
<3> works, globals always in scope
<4> DOES NOT WORK, variable is in an inner scope
<5> For good measure, log the global `window` object (`process` in node) and note how `favoriteSport` & `favoriteBaseballTeam` are properties of `window`.

### More Interesting / Complex

Now, let's break down a more complex example and discuss how JavaScript will interpret the code. 

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
var firstName = 'Homer';  // <1>
var lastName = 'Poe';   // <2>
var age = 19; // <3>

function displayPerson(fname, lname) { // <4>
  var prefix = 'Mr.';   // <5>
  var fullName = null; // <6>

  function getFullName() { // <7>
    var suffix = 'The First'; // <8>
    return  fullName = prefix + ' ' + fname + ' ' + lname + ' ' + suffix;
  }; // <9>

  return getFullName();
}; // <10>

function removeYears() { // <11>
  var minusYears = 10 // <12>
  var age = 49;       // <12>
  return age - minusYears;
}; // <13>

console.log(displayPerson(firstName, lastName));
console.log(removeYears());
----

Here's how JS will parse this:

<1> Found `firstName` variable declaration.
  - Put `firstName` variable in Global Scope.
<2> Found `lastName` variable declaration. 
  - Put `lastName` in Global Scope.
<3> Found `age` variable declaration. 
  - Put `age` in Global Scope.
<4> Found `displayPerson()` function declaration. 
  * Notice that `displayPerson()` is a function. 
  ** Create a inner scope and process this function. +
  _note: a function's parameters (i.e. `fname` and `lname`) behave just like local variables_
<5> Found the `prefix` variable declaration
  - Place in the `displayPerson` local function scope
<6> Found the `fullName` variable declarations. 
  - Place in the `displayPerson()` local function scope.
<7> Found `getFullName` declaration. 
  * Put `getFullName` in the `displayPerson()` function scope.
  * Notice that `getFullName` is a function. 
    ** create an inner scope and process this function.
<8> Found `suffix` variable declaration
  * Place in `getFullName` local function scope
<9> All done with `getFullName` function, no more variable declarations.
<10> All done with `displayPerson()` function, no more variable declarations.
<11> Found `removeYears()` function declaration. 
  * Put `removeYears()` in Global scope.
  * Notice that `removeYears()` value is a function. 
  ** create a inner scope and process this function.
<12> Found `age` and `minusYears` variable declarations. 
  * Put these in the function's scope.
<13> All done with `removeYears()` function, no more variable declarations

## Exercise

Break up into in teams of 2, 3, or 4.

Using the code sample below, discuss the scope of each variable and draw a diagram -- _similar to the example above seen above_.

Feel walk around the classroom and use the whiteboard or anything else that you can write on.

Once finished, compare with another team's deliverable.

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
var autoMake = "Ford";
var autoModel = "LTD";

function showAuto(year){
  function autoInfo(){
    var price = 124;
    console.log("Auto is a " + year + " " + autoMake + " " + autoModel + ", it's price is " + price + "$");
  }

  autoInfo();
};

showAuto(1969);
----

## Hoisting

JavaScript will allow you to declare new variables anywhere in your code, but the declarations are *hoisted* to the top of the enclosing function (or global scope) during execution.

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// What we wrote
function add(x, y) {
  x = x || 0;
  y = y || 0;
  var sum = x + y;       // <1>
  return sum;
}

// What gets executed
function add(x, y) {
  var sum;                // <2>
  x = x || 0;
  y = y || 0;
  sum = x + y;            // <3>
  return sum;
}
----
<1> We can write the declaration and the assignment deep into the function body.
<2> The declaration will get hoisted by the JavaScript runtime.
<3> The assignment of a value will *not* get hoisted.


TIP: To aid in readability, it is recommended to either declare the variables at the top of the function or to use the (new in ECMAScript 2015) block-scoped `let` and `const` keywords for declaring variables.


## Summary

* A variable or function has a *scope* that defines where the variable or function is valid -- _its lifespan_.
* JavaScript creates *scopes* at the *function* level for `var` variables and function declarations, +
and at the *block* level for `let` and `const` variables.
* Scopes are *nested* according to the nesting of the functions and blocks. +
Inner scopes can see the outer scopes they are nested within because they are still in scope.
* Any declarations outside of a function or block are *global* -- they belong to the *global* scope.
