## Ants Go Marching

* Create a new project titled debugging
** add an index.html file
** add a javascript file
** link the two files together
* In the JS file paste the above code
* there are several errors in this code sample
** use your debugger to track those errors down
* We've already got a `debugger` statement to start with.
* The finished output should be something like this:

[source,javascript]
.antsGoMarching
----
var littleOne = [];
var howTheyMarch = ["one by one", "two by two", "three by three", "four by four", "five by five", "six by six", "seven by seven", "eight by eight", "nine by nine", "ten by ten"];

function theAntsGoMarching(){
    for (var i = 0; i < howTheyMarch.length; i++){
        howManyByHowMany;
        console.log(littleOne[i]);
        console.log("And they all go marching down to the ground to get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!");
    }
}
theAntsGoMarching();

littleOne[0] = "The little one stops to suck her thumb";
littleOne[1] = "The little one stops to tie his shoe";
littleOne[2] = "The little one stops to climb a tree";
littleOne[3] = "The little one stops to shut the door";
littleOne[4] = "The little one stops to take a dive";
littleOne[5] = "The little one stops to pick up sticks";
littleOne[6] = "The little one stops to pray to heaven";
littleOne[7] = "The little one stops to roll a skate";
littleOne[8] = "The little one stops to check the time";
littleOne[9] = "The little one stops to shut The End";

function howManyByHowMany(number){
    var numbers = howTheyMarch;
    var hurrah = " hurrah, hurrah \n";
    var march = "The ants go marching " + numbers;
  debugger
    console.log(march + hurrah + march + hurrah + march);
}

## Baa Baa Blacksheep

* Using similar steps as above
* create another project
* link your html and JS
* Paste in the code below
* Debug it!

[source,javascript]
.baabaaBlacksheep
----
var woolOwners = [
  {
      "master": 1
  },
  {
    "dame": 1
  },
  {
    "little boy": 1,
    "location": "down the lane"
  }
];


var bags = haveYouAnyWool;

var haveYouAnyWool = function() {
    for (var i = 0; i < woolOwners.length; i++) {
    var totalBags = totalBags + i;
    }
    return (i);
};


function baabaaBlackSheep() {
    console.log("BaaBaa BlackSheep have you any wool?");
    if (bags > 0) {
        console.log("yes sir, yes sir " + totalBags + " bags full");
  }
}

function oneForMy() {
    for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        people = Object.keys(woolOwners);
        var person = people.toString();
        console.log("one for my " + person);
    }
}

baabaaBlackSheep();
oneForMy();

var boy = Object.keys(woolOwners[2]);
var littleBoy = boy[2];

var whereHeLives = littleBoy.location;
console.log("one for the " + littleBoy + " that lives " + whereHeLives);
----

* your output should be:
