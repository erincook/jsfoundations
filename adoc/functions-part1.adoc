## Learning Objectives

*After this lesson, developers will be able to:*

### Concepts

* **Describe** why functions are created
* **Explain** the single responsibility principle
* **Explain** what makes a function _reusable_
* **Describe** how parameters and arguments relate to functions
* **Explain** the concept of scope and how functions affect scope
* **Compare** global and local scope

### Skills

* **Create** functions in order to break programs into smaller sub-programs and include parameters if necessary
* **Call** a function passing in data (arguments) and getting back a result

## What is a function?

Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. They are a tool to help us reduce repetition and have predictability around what a piece of code will do. Functions help us to structure larger programs into a bunch of smaller sub-programs.

Functions also help us to define a vocabulary for a problem we are solving. This is unlike spoken language where we have more or less a fixed set of words in our vocabulary. We can create some new vocabulary to avoid repeating ourselves so much, repeating ourselves so much.

NOTE: One *best practice* in software engineering is the *DRY* principle, which stands for **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself. It means that we should avoid having multiple copies of a chunk of code (or data) because maintaining multiple copies is problematic. Functions is one way of avoiding duplicate code.

Take the below assembly line and imagine that one of these robot arms is responsible for attaching the driver door to the car. There's a lot that goes into that: identifying the car that's passing by, choosing the correct door, lifting the door, orienting the door properly, placing it on the car, bolting it to the chassis. _Phew_. We don't want to have to "say" all of those things to our robot arm, we just want to be able to tell it `attachDriverDoor`.

Imagine the assembly line below. All of these robots have _one_ job.

image::js-functions-assembly-line.jpg[]

We might _define_ our `attachDriverDoor` function something like this:

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
include::../src/robot-arm.js[tags=definition]
----

where `identifyCarType`, `selectDoor`, `liftDoor`, `alignDoor` & `boltDoorToChassis` are functions that we have defined elsewhere in our program and we _invoke_ them within the `attachDriverDoor` function. The term _invoke_ simply means to _call_ the function thus causing the function to execute and perform its work.

Can you guess what _invoking_ the `attachDriverDoor` function might look like?

[.result]
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
include::../src/robot-arm.js[tags=invocation]
----


### Functions are Like Math

Another useful analogy is to remember what _functions_ do in mathematics.

image::function_math.png[Math Functions]

Given a simple function

    y = f(x)

if we let f(x) = x^2
then we have:

    f(2) = 4
    f(3) = 9
    etc.

In Mathematics, functions have inputs, outputs, a name, and a definition.

It is similar in Computer Science.


## Why are Functions Important?

* Keep your code **DRY** - functions allow us to encapsulate and *reuse* a block of code
* **Abstraction** - functions allow us to define a problem and solve it in an encapsulated way
* **Testability** - because functions are well-defined, they are easy to test for correctness
* **Libraries** - Another form of reuse, we can use JavaScript libraries to contain functions we plan to use over and over


## Declaring a JavaScript Function

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// syntax for declaring a function
function <function_name>(parameters) {
   <function_body>
}
----

NOTE: We can try out this function in https://repl.it/languages/javascript[repl.it^]

.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// function declaration 
function square(x) { 
  return x * x; 
}
 
// calling the function
let y = square(3);
console.log("y = " + y);  // will print "y = 9"
----

This is a simple example of a function but there is a lot going on:

* We have defined a function with the name `square`
* The function takes a single parameter which has the name `x`
* The function has a body defined by `{` and `}` where the function does its work
* The function calculates the square of x
* The function returns the result of squaring x, which in this case is the argument `3` within the parenthasis when we call the function

## Definition

function:: a sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed.

Functions provide:

* Reuse
* Abstraction
* Testability


.JavaScript
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// find the average of two numbers 
function average(x, y) {
  return (x + y) / 2; 
}

 // calling the function 
let y = average(20, 40); 
console.log("y = " + y);  // will print "y = 30"
----

## The Return Statement

The *return* statement ends the execution of the function and (optionally) returns a value to the caller.


.basic-return
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function plusFive(number){
    return number + 5 // <1>
}

console.log(plusFive(10)) // <2>
// 15
----

<1> `return` the value of whatever number is passed in + 5
<2> print the value of the argument passed in which is: 10 + 5 


We can also write functions that return a value based on specific conditions.

.return-based-on-condition
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
// calculate income tax
function getTax(income) {
  if (income < 50000) {
    return income * 0.15;
  }
  else if (income < 100000) {
    return income * 0.20;
  }
  else {
    return income * 0.25;
  }
}

// calling the function
console.log("Tax on 40000 = " + getTax(40000));
console.log("Tax on 80000 = " + getTax(80000));
console.log("Tax on 120000 = " + getTax(120000));
----

In the above example, our function returns a value based on the condition. 

[IMPORTANT]
anything below a valid `return` statement will not be evaluated

.below-return
[source,javascript,linenums]
----

function sayHi(name){
    return "Hi " + name // <1>
    console.log(name)   // <2>
}
----

<1> return a string greeting the user by name
<2> this line will never be evaluated

## When There Is No Return Statement

Not all functions have a return value. Sometimes a function simply needs to perform an operation.

.no-return
[source,javascript,linenums]
----
function logger(value){
    console.log("!!!!!!! " + value + " !!!!!!!") // <1>
}

logger("foo")
// !!!!!!! foo !!!!!!!
----
<1> instead of returning a string, log the value with some exclamation points. 

Since a function is called to perform some task, the function must either:

a. *_return_* a value
b. *_change_* the environment in some way (a side-effect)
c. *_both_* a and b


## Labs - Fun with Functions

### Lab 1 - Fizzbuzz

FizzBuzz is a classic challenge that you may have performed in other languages. 

- Head over to link:https://github.homedepot.com/OM-JavaScript/JavaScript-Foundations-Exercises/tree/master/fizzBuzz[JSF FizzBuzz^] for more detailed instructions

- Starter code can be found at `JavaScript-Foundations-Exercises/fizzBuzz/index.js`

- The tests for this exercise can be started with `npm run test:fizzBuzz`

### Lab 3 - Review with JavaScripting

Complete the link:https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting[NodeSchool JavaScripting^] Exercises


#### Instructions

- Create a new directory named `javascripting` and `cd` into it

- If you are using an OM Device this module should have been previously installed. So you can skip to the link:https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting#run-the-workshop[Run the workshop^] section. Otherwise you'll need to install `javascripting globally`

- Start the app in your terminal by running `javascripting`

- Follow the instructions for Step 1, working your way through all of the challenges.


## Summary

* *Functions* are an essential part of JavaScript
* We can use *functions* to break up a large program into composable and reusable parts.
* With *functions* we can *DRY* up our code.
* A *function* should perform one specific task (the single responsibility principle).
* Functions take *parameters* and may return a *result*.
